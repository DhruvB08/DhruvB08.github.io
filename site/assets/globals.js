I\'m originally from India, but then moved to the United States when I was just 2 years old. For a few years my family stayed in Edison, then after the end of my 3rd grade, we moved to East Brunswick. From 4th grade to 12th grade I was living in East Brunswick. During college I\'ve been bouncing back and forth between New Brunswick and East Brunswick, and I\'d like to consider both places my home really.';

			<h1 class="header">About Me</h1>
			<p>I'm a college student, currently attending Rutgers University. I'll be graduating in May 2018, with a B.S. in Computer Science as well as a B.S. in Economics, both done during my 4 years here at Rutgers. I was originally from India, but then moved to the United States when I was just 2 years old. For a few years my family stayed in Edison, then after the end of my 3rd grade, we moved to East Brunswick. From 4th grade to 12th grade I was living in East Brunswick. During college I've been bouncing back and forth between New Brunswick and East Brunswick, and I'd like to consider both places my home really.</p>
